# Smart Brain App - Full-stack project

https://smart-brain-faceapp1-front-end.herokuapp.com/

This is the final state of a project that I worked on whilst following along **'The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery"** course, by Andrei Naegoie, that I bought on Udemy.

This course is what got me started in the world of web development and it guided me through a lot of extremely useful techniques and information. We worked on a number of small projects initially to learn core concepts before ultimately working on this project for over half of the course.

## Overview

### The challenge

Initially the challenge was to get through the whole course, developping and ultimately deploying a full functioning web app with a working front-end and back-end. The intention of this course, for me, was to gain an understanding of the steps, processes, tools and skills required to create a fully functioning web app.

Whilst working on this project I would regularly take time away to work on other little projects, usually projects on frontendmentors.com, so that I could practice what I had been taught in a seperate and different environment to the one which had been set up throughout this tutorial.
By the end of the course I felt that I had learnt so much, not only from what had been taught during the course but also through my own challenges, problems and researching that I did. I had always had the intention to modify the project on the front end to make it more unique to myself, but by the time I got to the end of the project I felt I had enough confidence to implement what I felt were necessary changes [such as displaying error messages to the user on the page whenever there is a problem, something which the course did not implement]

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
